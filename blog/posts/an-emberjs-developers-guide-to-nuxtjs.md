title: An Ember.js Developer's Guide to Nuxt.js
---

I am a huge Ember.js fan, but recently wanted to experiment with some other frameworks, and decided to try Nuxt.js.
I was very pleasantly surprised, that Nuxt had many nice "magic" things, just like Ember had, and felt very familiar
to Ember development. There were a lot of additional nice features as well, like built in PWA support, static site 
generation, tree shaking, and code splitting. With all of these awesome features, I decided to convert shipshape.io
from Ember to Nuxt, and wanted to document the mappings between things in Ember and Nuxt and the benefits and drawbacks of
each.

## {{outlet}} -> <nuxt/>

## {{yield}}  -> <slot/>
