        <h4>Challenge</h4>

        <p>
          Users of Acquia's Lift product were finding it difficult to manage the
          content rules for dynamically determining what their site visitors
          would see. This has been in an admin dashboard placed over the
          customer's site in context as a set of seperate iframes that must
          messaage to one another.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionaly, the Lift development team had issues managing messaging
          across many individual Ember apps that were created in each iframed
          sandbox, which were intended to syncronize data changes as the user
          added or updated configurations.
        </p>
